   **Are you trying to run your first fMRI experiment? Or your fifth?**

   Well, this is the place for you! We understand that running functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies is *not* trivial, and there are a lot of many questions along the way. Here, you will find good principles in fMRI data analysis where they exist and thoughts/suggestions where there aren't set standards. We hope that this handbook will be useful as you embark on your own journey doing fMRI experiments! 

   Currently, this handbook is still under initial development. `Please contact us <https://github.com/brainhack-princeton/handbook/issues/new>`_ if you have any questions, feedback, or suggestions!
