Looking without touching
------------------------

Only now, several weeks into the DataLad-101 course does your room
mate realize that he has enrolled in the course as well, but has not
yet attended at all. "Oh man, can you help me catch up?" he asks
you one day. "Sharing just your notes would be really cool for a
start already!"

"Sure thing", you say, and decide that it's probably best if he gets
all of the ``DataLad-101`` course dataset. Sharing datasets was
something you wanted to look into soon, anyway.

This is one exciting aspect of DataLad datasets has yet been missing
from this course: How does one share a dataset?
In this section, we will cover the simplest way of sharing a dataset:
on a local or shared file system, via an installation with a path as
a source.

In this scenario multiple people can access the very same files at the
same time, often on the same machine (e.g., a shared workstation, or
a server than people can "SSH" into). You might think: "What do I need
DataLad for, if everyone can already access everything?" However,
universal, unrestricted access can easily lead to chaos. DataLad can
help facilitate collaboration without requiring ultimate trust and
reliability of all participants. Essentially, with a shared dataset,
collaborators can look and use your dataset without ever touching it.

To demonstrate how to share a DataLad dataset on a common file system,
we will pretend that your personal computer
can be accessed by other users. Let's pretend that
your room mate has access, and you're installing
the ``DataLad-101`` dataset in a different place in the file system
for him to access and work with.

This is indeed a common real-world use case: Two users on a shared
file system sharing a dataset with each other.
But as we can not easily simulate a second user in this handbook,
for now, you will have to share your dataset with yourself.
This endeavor serves several purposes: For one, you will experience a very easy
way of sharing a dataset. Secondly, it will show you the installation
of a dataset from a path (instead of a URL as shown in the section
:ref:`installds`). Thirdly, ``DataLad-101`` is a dataset that can
showcase many different properties of a dataset already, but it will
be an additional learning experience to see how the different parts
of the dataset -- text files, larger files, datalad subdataset,
:command:`datalad run` commands -- will appear upon installation when shared.
And lastly, you will likely "share a dataset with yourself" whenever you
will be using a particular dataset of your own creation as input for
one or more projects.

"Awesome!" exclaims your room mate as you take out your Laptop to
share the dataset. "You're really saving my ass
here. I'll make up for it when we prepare for the final", he promises.

To install ``DataLad-101`` with :command:`datalad install` into a different part
of your file system, navigate out of ``DataLad-101``, and -- for
simplicity -- create a new directory, ``mock_user``, right next to it:

.. runrecord:: _examples/DL-101-116-101
   :language: console
   :workdir: dl-101
   :realcommand: mkdir mock_user
   :notes: (hope this works)
   :cast: 04_collaboration

   $ cd ../
   $ mkdir mock_user

For simplicity, pretend that this is a second users' -- your room mates' --
home directory. Furthermore, let's for now disregard anything about
permissions. In a real-world example you likely would not be able to read and write
to a different user's directories, but we will talk about permissions later.

After creation, navigate into ``mock_user`` and install
the dataset ``DataLad-101`` by specifying its path as a ``--source``
(remember, the shorter option ``-s`` would work as well).

.. runrecord:: _examples/DL-101-116-102
   :language: console
   :workdir: dl-101
   :notes: We pretend to install the DataLad-101 dataset into a different users home directory. To do this, we use datalad install with a path
   :cast: 04_collaboration


   $ cd mock_user
   $ datalad install --source ../DataLad-101 --description "DataLad-101 in mock_user"

This will install your dataset ``DataLad-101`` in your room mate's home
directory. Note that we have given this new
dataset a description about its location as well. Note further that we
have not provided a path to :command:`datalad install`, and hence it installed the
dataset under its original name in the current directory.

Together with your room mate, you go ahead and see what this dataset looks
like. Before running the command, try to predict what you will see.

.. runrecord:: _examples/DL-101-116-103
   :language: console
   :workdir: dl-101/mock_user
   :notes: How do you think does the dataset look like
   :cast: 04_collaboration

   $ cd DataLad-101
   $ tree

There are a number of interesting things, and your room mate is the
first to notice them:

"Hey, can you explain some things to me?", he asks. "This directory
here, "``longnow``", why is it empty?"
True, the subdataset has a directory name but apart from this,
the ``longnow`` directory appears empty.

"Also, why do the PDFs in ``books/`` and the ``.jpg`` files
appear so weird? They have
this cryptic path right next to them, and look, if I try to open
one of them, it fails! Did something go wrong when we installed
the dataset?" he worries.
Indeed, the PDFs and pictures appear just as they did in the original dataset
on first sight: They are symlinks pointing to some location in the
object tree. To reassure your room mate that everything is fine you
quickly explain to him the concept of a symlink and the :term:`object-tree`
of :term:`Git-annex`.

"But why does the PDF not open when I try to open it?" he repeats.
True, these files cannot be opened. This mimics our experience when
installing the ``longnow`` subdataset: Right after installation,
the ``.mp3`` files also could not be opened, because their file
content was not yet retrieved. You begin to explain to your room mate
how DataLad retrieves only minimal metadata about which files actually
exist in a dataset upon a :command:`datalad install`. "It's really handy",
you tell him. "This way you can decide which book you want to read,
and then retrieve what you need. Everything that is *annexed* is retrieved
on demand. Note though that the text files
contents are present, and the files can be opened -- this is because
these files are stored in :term:`Git`. So you already have my notes,
and you can decide for yourself whether you want to ``get`` the books."

To demonstrate this, you decide to examine the PDFs further.
"Try to get one of the books", you instruct your room mate:

.. runrecord:: _examples/DL-101-116-104
   :language: console
   :workdir: dl-101/mock_user/DataLad-101
   :notes: how does it feel to get a file?
   :cast: 04_collaboration

   $ datalad get books/progit.pdf

"Opening this file will work, because the content was retrieved from
the original dataset.", you explain, proud that this worked just as you
thought it would. Your room mate is excited by this magical
command. You however begin to wonder: how does DataLad know where to look for
that original content?

This information comes from Git-annex. Before getting the next PDF,
let's query Git-annex where its content is stored:

.. runrecord:: _examples/DL-101-116-105
   :language: console
   :workdir: dl-101/mock_user/DataLad-101
   :notes: git-annex whereis to find out where content is stored
   :cast: 04_collaboration

   $ git annex whereis books/TLCL.pdf

Oh, another :term:`shasum`! This time however not in a symlink...
"That's hard to read -- what is it?" your room mate asks.
Luckily, there is a human-readable description next to it:
"course on DataLad-101 on my private Laptop".
"This", you exclaim, excited about your own realization,
"is my datasets location I'm sharing it from!"

This is, finally, where we see the description provided in
:command:`datalad create` in section :ref:`createDS` becomes handy: It is
a human-readable description of *where* file content is stored.
This becomes especially useful when the number of repositories
increases. If you have only one other dataset it may be easy to
remember what and where it is. But once you have one back-up
of your dataset on a USB-Stick, one dataset shared with
`Dropbox <dropbox.com>`_, and a third one on your institutions
Gitlab instance you will be grateful for the descriptions
you provided these locations with.

The message further informs you that there is only "``(1 copy)``"
of this file content. This makes sense: There
is only your own, original ``DataLad-101`` dataset in which
this book is saved.

To retrieve file content of an annexed file such as one of
these PDFs, Git-annex will try
to obtain it from the locations it knows to contain this content.
It uses the checksums to identify these locations. Every copy
of a dataset will get a unique ID with such a checksum.
Note however that just because Git-annex knows a certain location
where content was once it does not guarantee that retrieval will
work. If one location is a USB-Stick that is in your bag pack instead
of your USB port,
a second location is a hard drive that you deleted all of its
previous contents (including dataset content) from,
and another location is a web server, but you are not connected
to the internet, Git-annex will not succeed in retrieving
contents from these locations.
As long as there is at least one location that contains
the file and is accessible, though, Git-annex will get the content.

Let's now turn to the fact that the subdataset ``longnow`` does
not contain not only no file content, but also no file metadata
information to explore the contents of the dataset: There are no
subdirectories or any files under ``recordings/longnow/``.
This is behavior that you have not observed until now.

To fix this and obtain file availability metadata,
you have to run a somewhat unexpected command:

.. runrecord:: _examples/DL-101-116-106
   :language: console
   :workdir: dl-101/mock_user/DataLad-101
   :notes: how do we get the subdataset? currently it looks empty. --> a plain datalad install
   :cast: 04_collaboration

   $ datalad install recordings/longnow

Let's what has changed (excerpt):

.. runrecord:: _examples/DL-101-116-107
   :language: console
   :workdir: dl-101/mock_user/DataLad-101
   :lines: 1-30
   :notes: what has changed? --> file metadata information!
   :cast: 04_collaboration

   $ tree

Interesting! The file metadata information is now present, and we can
explore the file hierarchy. The file content, however, is not present yet.

What has happened here?

When DataLad installs a dataset, it will by default only install the
superdataset, and not any subdatasets. The superdataset contains the
information that a subdataset exists though -- the subdataset is *registered*
in the superdataset.  This is why the subdataset name exists as a directory.
A subsequent :command:`datalad install` in ``recordings/longnow/``
or a :command:`datalad install PATH/TO/longnow` will install the registered dataset without
the need to specify the source again, just as we did it in the example above.

To explicitly install a dataset right away
*recursively*, that is, all of the subdatasets inside it as well, one
has to specify the ``-r``/``--recursive`` option::

  datalad install --source ../DataLad-101 -r --description "DataLad-101 in mock_user"

would have installed the ``longnow`` subdataset as well, and the meta
data about file hierarchies would have been available right from the
start.

So why is this behavior disabled by default?
In :ref:`nesting` we learned that datasets can be nested *arbitrarily* deep.
Upon installing a dataset you might not want to also install a few dozen levels of
nested subdatasets right away.

However, there is a middle way: The ``--recursion-limit`` option let's
you specify how many levels of subdatasets should be installed together
with the superdataset::

  datalad install -s ../DataLad-101 --description "DataLad-101 in mock_user" -r --recursion-limit 1

Hence, this alternative command would have installed the subdataset right away.

To summarize what you learned in this section, write a note on how to
install a dataset using a path as a source on a common file system.
Include the options ``-r``/``--recursive`` and ``--recursion-limit``.

Write this note in "your own" (the original) ``DataLad-101`` dataset, though!

.. runrecord:: _examples/DL-101-116-108
   :language: console
   :workdir: dl-101/mock_user/DataLad-101
   :notes: note in original DataLad-101 dataset
   :cast: 04_collaboration

   # navigate back into the original dataset
   $ cd ../../DataLad-101
   # write the note
   $ cat << EOT >> notes.txt
   A source to install a dataset from can also be a path,
   for example as in "datalad install -s ../DataLad-101".
   As when installing datasets before, make sure to add a
   description on the location of the dataset to be
   installed, and, if you want, a path to where the dataset
   should be installed under which name.

   Note that subdatasets will not be installed by default --
   you will have to do a plain
   "datalad install PATH/TO/SUBDATASET", or specify the
   -r/--recursive option in the install command:
   "datalad install -s ../DataLad-101 -r".

   A recursive installation would however install all
   installed subdatasets, so a safer way to proceed is to
   set a decent --recursion-limit:
   "datalad install -s ../DataLad-101 -r --recursion-limit 2"

   EOT
