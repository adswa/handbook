<p>The DataLad handbook is not the DataLad documentation, and it is also
not an explanation of the computational magic that happens in the background.
Instead, it is a procedurally oriented, hands-on crash-course that invites
you to fire up your terminal and follow along.</p>
<p><strong>If you are interested in learning how to use DataLad, this handbook is for you.</strong></p>
<p>You do not need to be a programmer, computer scientist, or Linux-crank.
If you have never touched your computers shell before, you will be fine.
No knowledge about <a class="reference internal" href="../glossary.html#term-git"><span class="xref std std-term">Git</span></a> or <a class="reference internal" href="../glossary.html#term-git-annex"><span class="xref std std-term">Git-annex</span></a> is required or necessary.
Regardless of your background and personal use cases for DataLad, the
handbook will show you the principles of DataLad, and from chapter 1 onwards
you will be using them.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-to-read-this-book">
<h2>How to read this book<a class="headerlink" href="#how-to-read-this-book" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>First of all: Be excited. DataLad can help you to manage your digital data
workflow in various ways, and in this book you will use many of them right
from the start.
There are many topics you can explore, if you wish:
Local or collaborative workflows, reproducible analyses, data publishing, … .
If anything seems particularly exciting, you can go ahead, read it, <em>and do it</em>.
Therefore, <strong>grab your computer, and be ready to use it</strong>.</p>
<p>Every chapter will give you different challenges, starting from basic local
workflows to more advanced commands, and you will see your skills increase
with each. While learning, it will be easy to
<strong>find use cases in your own work for the commands you come across</strong>.</p>
<p>As the handbook is to be a practical guide it includes as many hands-on examples
as we can fit into it. Code snippets look like this, and you should
<strong>copy them into your own terminal to try them out</strong>, but you can also
<strong>modify them to fit your custom needs in your own use cases</strong>.
Note in the example below that shows the creation of a DataLad dataset how
we distinguish <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">comments</span> <span class="pre">(#)</span></code> from <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">commands</span> <span class="pre">($)</span></code> and their output:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># this is a comment used for additional explanations. Anything preceded by $ is a command to try.</span>
<span class="c1"># if the line starts with neither # nor $, its the output of a command</span>
$ datalad create myfirstrepo
<span class="o">[</span>INFO   <span class="o">]</span> Creating a new annex repo at /home/adina/DataLad-101
create<span class="o">(</span>ok<span class="o">)</span>: /home/adina/DataLad-101 <span class="o">(</span>dataset<span class="o">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Note: When copying code snippets into your own terminal, do not copy the leading
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">$</span></code> – this only indicates that the line is a command, and would lead to an
error when you’d try to execute it.</p>
<p>The book is split between two different parts. The upcoming chapters
are a <em>Basics</em> part that intends to show you the core DataLad functionality
and challenges you to use it. It is recommended to read this part from
start to end and follow along.
In the chapter <em>use cases</em> you will find concrete examples of
DataLad applications for general inspiration – this is the second part of this book.
Pick whatever you find interesting, and disregard the rest.
In general, we recommend to read the Basics first. Afterwards,
you might even consider <a class="reference internal" href="../contributing.html#contribute"><span class="std std-ref">Contributing</span></a> to this book by sharing your own use case.</p>
<p>Note that many challenges can have straightforward and basic solutions,
but a lot of additional options or improvements are possible.
Sometimes one could get lost in all of the available DataLad functionality,
or in some interesting backgrounds about a command.
For this reason we put all of the basics in plain sight, and those basics
will let you master a given task and get along comfortably.
Having the basics will be your multi-purpose swiss army knife.
But if you want to have the special knowledge for a very peculiar type
of problem set or that extra increase in skill or understanding,
you’ll have to do a detour into some of the <em>hidden</em> parts of the book:
When there are command options or explanations that go beyond basics and
best practices, we hide them in foldable book sections in order
to not be too distracting for anyone only interested in the basics.
You can decide for yourself whether you want to check them out:</p>
<div class="toggle findoutmore docutils container">
<div class="header docutils container">
<p><strong>Find out more: </strong>Click here to show/hide further commands</p>
</div>
<p>Sections like this contain content that goes beyond the basics
necessary to complete a challenge.</p>
</div>
<p>Note further that…</p>
<div class="admonition gitusernote">
<p class="admonition-title">Note for Git users</p>
<p>DataLad uses <a class="reference internal" href="../glossary.html#term-git"><span class="xref std std-term">Git</span></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="../glossary.html#term-git-annex"><span class="xref std std-term">Git-annex</span></a> underneath the hood. Readers that
are familiar with these tools can find occasional notes on how a DataLad
command links to a Git(-annex) command or concept in boxes like this.
There is, however, absolutely no knowledge of Git or Git-annex necessary
to follow this book. You will, though, encounter Git commands throughout
the book when there is no better alternative, and executing those commands will
suffice to follow along.</p>
</div>
<p>Apart from core DataLad commands (introduced in the second part of this book),
DataLad also comes with many extensions and advanced commands not (yet) referenced
in this handbook. The development of many of these features
is ongoing, and this handbook will incorporate all DataLad commands and extensions
<em>once they are stable</em> (that is, once the command(-structure) is likely to not
change in the future anymore). If you are looking for a feature but cannot find it in this
handbook, please take a look at the <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.datalad.org">documentation</a>,

<div class="section" id="what-you-will-learn-in-this-book">
<h3>What you will learn in this book<a class="headerlink" href="#what-you-will-learn-in-this-book" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This handbook will teach you simple and yet advanced principles of data
management for reproducible, comprehensible, transparent, and
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/">FAIR</a> data
projects. It does so with hands-on tool use of DataLad and its
underlying software, blended with clear explanations of relevant
theoretical backgrounds whenever necessary, and by demonstrating
organizational and procedural guidelines and standards for data
related projects on concrete examples.</p>
<p>You will learn how to create, consume, structure, share, publish, and use
<em>DataLad datasets</em>: modular, reusable components that can be version-controlled,
linked, and that are able to capture and track full provenance of their
contents, if used correctly.</p>
<p>At the end of the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Basics</span></code> section, these are some of the main
things you will know how to do, and understand why doing them is useful:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Version-control</strong> data objects, regardless of size, keep track of
and <strong>update</strong> (from) their sources and shared copies, and capture the
<strong>provenance</strong> of all data objects whether you consume them from any source
or create them yourself.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Build up complete projects</strong> with data as independent, version-controlled,
provenance-tracked, and linked DataLad dataset(s) that allow <strong>distribution</strong>,
modular <strong>reuse</strong>, and are <strong>transparent</strong> both in their structure and their
development to their current and future states.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Bind</strong> modular components into complete data analysis projects, and comply
to procedural and organizational principles that will help to create transparent
and comprehensible projects to ease <strong>collaboration</strong> and <strong>reproducibility</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Share</strong> complete data objects, version-controlled as a whole, but including
modular components such as data in a way that preserves the history,
provenance, and linkage of its components.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>At the end of this handbook, you will find it easy to create, build up, and
share intuitively structured and version-controlled data projects that
fulfill high standards for reproducibility and FAIRness. You are able to
decide for yourself into how much of the DataLad world you want to dive in
based on your individual use cases, and with every section you will learn
more about state-of-the-art data management.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-storyline">
<h3>The storyline<a class="headerlink" href="#the-storyline" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Most of the sections in the upcoming chapter follow a continuous <strong>narrative</strong>.
This narrative aims to be as domain-agnostic and relatable as possible, but
it also needs to be able to showcase all of the principles and commands
of DataLad. Therefore, we will build up together a DataLad project for the
fictional educational course <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DataLad-101</span></code>.</p>
<p>Envision yourself in the last educational course you took or taught:
Probably, you’ve created some files with notes you took, a directory
with slides or books for further reading, and a place where you stored
assignments and their solutions in. This is what we will be doing as well.
This project will start with creating the necessary directory structures,
populating them by <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">installing</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">creating</span></code> several
<a class="reference internal" href="../glossary.html#term-datalad-subdataset"><span class="xref std std-term">DataLad subdataset</span></a>s, adding files and changing their content,
and executing simple scripts with input data to create results we can
share and publish with DataLad.</p>
<p>If you do not want to follow along and only read, there will be a
finished DataLad-101 project for you to download and explore in the future.
The dataset will contain tags that relate different states of it to the
respective book sections.</p>
