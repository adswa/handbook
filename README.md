# Princeton Handbook for Reproducible Neuroimaging :orange_book:

This is a living resource on best practices in reproducible neuroimaging for the [Princeton Neuroscience Institute](https://pni.princeton.edu/). The handbook is rendered on the web [here](http://brainhack-princeton.github.io/handbook/) (http://brainhack-princeton.github.io/handbook), and is currently under initial development.

The handbook is intended to be a practical, hands-on guide for running an fMRI experiment. The target audience is graduate students and postdocs planning to start their first fMRI experiment, but the principles and tools may be valuable to veterans as well. The handbook can't cover every use-case or experiment, so we focus on the most typical use-cases.

## Contributing

Contributions in any form (pull requests, issues, content requests/ideas) are always welcome! If you notice any irregularities in the handbook, please us know by [raising an issue](https://github.com/brainhack-princeton/handbook/issues). You can find the recommended workflow for contributing [here](https://brainhack-princeton.github.io/handbook/contributing.html).

## Acknowledgements and contributors

This handbook is collaboratively authored by attendees of the weekly neuroimaging support group at Princeton (also known as "Pygers"). The structure of this handbook borrows heavily from the [DataLad Handbook](http://handbook.datalad.org/) and we thank the DataLad authors for providing such a useful resource. The initial momentum to create a public resource stemmed from the Brainhack Princeton 2019 event sponsored by the [ReproNim Center for Reproducible Neuroimaging Computation](https://www.repronim.org/), [Intel Labs](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/research/overview.html), and the [Princeton University Department of Psychology Langfeld Fund](https://psych.princeton.edu/). We're especially grateful to Matteo Visconti di Oleggio Castello for providing mentorship at the hackathon and advising development of the handbook.

This project follows the [all-contributors](https://github.com/all-contributors/all-contributors) specification. Contributions of any kind welcome!
